# Catena-X IAM: Keycloak instances

This repository contains the reference configuration to deploy the Catena-X (CX) specific Keycloak instances.
The instances depend on the [helm chart from Bitnami](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/keycloak/7.1.18) (chart version 7.1.18, app version 16.1.1).

The repository is split up in:

* The helm charts to deploy the CX Keycloak instances
* The CX specific configuration (e.g. keycloak-themes and initial realm-config)
* The dockerfile (Dockerfile.import) to build an image containing the CX specific configuration which is used as init container at Keycloak Startup.
